# Minimum Viable Configuration Management

Configuration management systems have become very complex beyond the needs of
many. Sometimes you need to do something simple on many hosts and be able to
audit the security of how this something simple is ran on many hosts.

## Risks

* Environment Variable Overlap
* Variable not unset correctly

## Secrets

There are almost to many ways to handle secrets wrong and correctly.

### File method

In a directory called secrets we load files with the .mvcm ext

* This is horrible but fast
* The gitignore is set to exclude *.mvcm

## Todo

* Everything, this is a proof of concept
